---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Separate Config Files for AWS
**Decision**: Keep `config.ini` (HPC/local) separate from `aws/config/aws_config.ini`  
**Rationale**: Different environments need different settings (file paths vs S3 buckets)  
**Impact**: Clean separation of concerns, no unused parameters

### 2. /tmp Staging in Lambda
**Decision**: Use ephemeral storage staging, not direct S3 streaming  
**Rationale**: Local I/O 2-3× faster, simpler error handling, HPC script compatibility  
**Impact**: Works for prototype, may need revisiting for large-scale production

### 3. Centralized Sentinel-2 Downloads
**Decision**: Single shared download folder, not per-region folders  
**Rationale**: Regions share 2-4 MGRS tiles in Greenland  
**Impact**: Zero duplication, massive storage savings

### 4. Mixed Platform Strategy
**Decision**: Lambda for small regions (76%), HPC for large regions (24%)  
**Rationale**: Lambda has hard 10 GB memory limit, large regions need ~16 GB  
**Impact**: Optimal cost and reliability for all 196 regions

## Pain Points, Solutions & Limitations

### 1. AWS Lambda Memory Constraint - **HARD LIMIT DISCOVERED**

**Pain Point**: Large Sentinel-2 regions (4+ tiles) exceed Lambda's maximum memory

**Discovery Process**:
- Initially: 5 GB memory worked for small regions (1-2 tiles) ✅
- Region 191_Hagen_Brae (4 tiles): OOM at 5 GB after 155s (32% progress)
- Progressive testing: Increased to 8 GB → OOM at 205s (43% progress)
- Final test: 10 GB (Lambda MAXIMUM) → OOM at 301s (63% progress)
- **Conclusion**: Would need ~16 GB to complete, but Lambda max is 10 GB

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Mixed Platform Strategy**: 76% of regions (1-2 tiles) → Lambda, 24% (4+ tiles) → HPC
- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: Region metadata includes tile count for routing
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: Process 149/196 regions on serverless, large ones on HPC

**Status**: ⚠️ **ACCEPTED LIMITATION** - Cannot process 4+ tile regions on Lambda (physically impossible)

**Impact**: Clear criteria for platform selection, documented in production planning

---

### 2. Line Ending Chaos - Windows/WSL Mismatch

**Pain Point**: Python scripts failed with `IndentationError` despite looking correct

**Root Cause**:
- Editing in WSL (LF endings) → Committing from Windows Git → Auto CRLF conversion
- Python interpreter cannot parse `\r` characters
- Code appeared corrupted with mangled indentation in editors

**Discovery**:
- User's brilliant insight: "Could this problem have happened by switching between windows and WSL?"
- File check revealed: "ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators" (should be "ASCII text")
- Located in: `1_download_merge_and_clip/landsat/lib/functions.py`

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Immediate Fix**: `sed -i 's/\r$//' file.py` to convert CRLF → LF
- ✅ **Prevention**: Created `.gitattributes` (4.7 KB) forcing LF endings for all code files
- ✅ **Documentation**: `LINE_ENDING_FIX.md` for team troubleshooting
- ✅ **Workflow Change**: Develop entirely in WSL/Linux to avoid OS mismatches

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - All code files now enforce LF endings via Git

**Impact**: No more silent failures from line ending conversions

---

### 3. Duplicate Import Statement - Python Scoping Bug

**Pain Point**: `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'os'` in working code

**Root Cause**:
- File: `1_download_merge_and_clip/landsat/lib/functions.py` line 144
- `import os` appeared twice: once at module level (line 17), once inside function (line 144)
- Python scoping rule: Any assignment in function makes variable local throughout function
- Code tried to use `os` before the import statement executed → UnboundLocalError

**Discovery**:
- Error message pointed to line using `os`, not the duplicate import
- Only visible when reading full file carefully
- Combined with CRLF issue, made file appear corrupted

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Fix**: `sed -i '144d' functions.py` to delete duplicate import
- ✅ **Validation**: `python3 -m py_compile` to verify syntax
- ✅ **Prevention**: Code review before commits, use linters

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Duplicate import removed

**Impact**: Landsat processing immediately started working (was failing silently)

---

### 4. Satellite Cross-Contamination - Shared /tmp Directory

**Pain Point**: Landsat upload included 26 Sentinel-2 files (should be 4 Landsat files)

**Root Cause**:
- Both satellites saved to shared `/tmp/glacier_processing/output/` directory
- Upload function searched entire output directory and found BOTH satellite outputs
- Complex glob pattern matching attempted but failed due to different directory structures

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **HPC-Inspired Architecture**: Satellite-specific isolated directories
  - Landsat: `/tmp/glacier_processing/landsat/`
  - Sentinel-2: `/tmp/glacier_processing/sentinel2/`
- ✅ **Simple Upload Logic**: Upload entire satellite directory (no complex patterns)
- ✅ **Cleanup**: `shutil.rmtree()` after upload to prevent /tmp exhaustion
- ✅ **Result**: 0 cross-contamination, 100% clean isolation

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Complete satellite isolation achieved

**Impact**: Landsat: 4 files ✅, Sentinel-2: 14 files ✅, no contamination

---

### 5. ConfigParser Inline Comment Failure

**Pain Point**: `ParsingError` when reading `aws_config.ini` with inline comments

**Root Cause**:
- ConfigParser requires strict INI format
- Inline comments after values cause parsing errors
- Example: `memory_size = 5120 # 5 GB` → FAILS
- Correct: `# 5 GB` on separate line, then `memory_size = 5120` → WORKS

**Discovery**:
- Error appeared when integrating Lambda configuration
- Not immediately obvious which line caused the issue
- Required understanding ConfigParser documentation

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Fix**: Moved all inline comments to separate lines above the value
- ✅ **Documentation**: Added comment format guidelines to config files
- ✅ **Validation**: Test parsing before committing config changes

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - All config files use proper INI format

**Impact**: Robust configuration loading, clear documentation

---

### 6. Docker Layer Caching - Stale Code in Containers

**Pain Point**: Lambda showed old behavior after updating `lambda_handler.py`

**Root Cause**:
- Docker COPY layer cached even when source file modified
- Build completed quickly using cached layers
- Stale code deployed to production

**Symptoms**:
- Lambda logs showed old function logic
- Local file had correct code, but Lambda didn't
- Confusion about whether deployment actually happened

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Force Rebuild**: `docker build --no-cache` to bypass all caching
- ✅ **Touch Files**: `touch lambda_handler.py` to bust specific cache
- ✅ **Automated Script**: `deploy_lambda_container.sh` handles rebuild, ECR push, Lambda update
- ✅ **Verification**: Check ECR image timestamp, test Lambda immediately after deploy

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Use `--no-cache` for critical updates

**Impact**: Ensured deployed code matches local code, no more stale deployments

---

### 7. Path Resolution - Multi-Environment Complexity

**Pain Point**: Hardcoded paths failed when moving between HPC, local, and Lambda

**Root Cause**:
- Initial code used absolute paths: `/fs/project/howat.4/yadav.111/...`
- Paths valid on HPC but not on local WSL or Lambda
- Multiple fallback attempts led to complex, fragile code

**Discovery**:
- Files downloaded to Lambda S3 but scripts couldn't find them
- Path: `script_dir / 'ancillary'` looked INSIDE sentinel2 folder (wrong!)
- Should be: `script_dir.parent / 'ancillary'` to reference SIBLING directory

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Relative Paths**: `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / 'ancillary'`
- ✅ **Single Source**: Direct path resolution based on script location
- ✅ **Directory Structure Understanding**: ancillary is sibling to sentinel2, not child
- ✅ **Result**: Works across HPC, local, Lambda without fallback logic

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Clean path resolution everywhere

**Impact**: Same code runs on all platforms without modification

---

### 8. S3 Structure Inconsistency - Platform Confusion

**Pain Point**: Different directory structures on local/HPC vs AWS S3

**Root Cause**:
- Local/HPC: `/home/bny/greenland_glacier_flow/1_download_merge_and_clip/{satellite}/`
- AWS (old): `s3://bucket/results/{job_name}/mixed_files/`
- Researchers confused navigating results across platforms

**Impact**:
- Cannot use same tools/scripts on both platforms
- Documentation must explain two different structures
- Data transfer requires path remapping

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Standardization**: `s3_base_path = 1_download_merge_and_clip` in config
- ✅ **Updated Lambda**: `f"{s3_base_path}/{satellite}/{relative_path}"`
- ✅ **Result**: `s3://bucket/1_download_merge_and_clip/sentinel2/` matches local structure
- ✅ **Benefit**: Same navigation experience across all platforms

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Perfect structural consistency

**Impact**: Seamless data transfer, familiar navigation, reduced cognitive load

---

### 9. Conda Licensing - Miniconda ToS Restrictions

**Pain Point**: Conda environment creation blocked in AWS Lambda containers

**Root Cause**:
- Miniconda Terms of Service restrictions in containerized environments
- Automated Docker builds failed with licensing errors
- Cannot use conda in production Lambda containers

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **HPC/Local**: Use Miniforge (conda-forge based, licensing compliant)
- ✅ **AWS Lambda**: Use pip-based installation (no conda in containers)
- ✅ **Future Recommendation**: Use Pixi for cloud deployments (conda-forge default, better geospatial support than pip)

**Status**: ✅ **WORKED AROUND** - Different package managers for different environments

**Impact**: All geospatial libraries successfully installed, no licensing violations

---

### 10. STAC API Tile Bloat - Unnecessary Downloads

**Pain Point**: STAC API returned 4-6 tiles when only 1 needed for region 134_Arsuk

**Root Cause**:
- STAC API returns ALL tiles that geometrically intersect region
- Includes tiles with <5% overlap (edge cases)
- No filtering before download → wasted bandwidth

**Discovery**:
- Manual inspection showed most tiles barely touched region boundary
- Region metadata contains pre-curated UTM grid IDs
- Example: 134_Arsuk should only use `['22VFP']` (not all 6 tiles)

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Pre-Download Filtering**: `items = [item for item in items if item.id.split("_")[1] in tile_ids]`
- ✅ **Metadata Integration**: Read `utm_grid` field from glacier regions file
- ✅ **Result**: 83% reduction for 134_Arsuk (6→1 tiles), 50-60% for large regions

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** - Massive bandwidth savings

**Impact**: 50-70% reduction in total downloads for 196 regions

**Evolution**: Python configs → INI files → Clean INI with proper comments  
**Best Practice**: Comments on separate lines, validated parsing

### 5. Documentation Value
**Lesson**: Comprehensive documentation enables smooth handoff and collaboration  
**Evidence**: 2000+ lines of documentation created  
**Impact**: Future team members can understand "why" behind decisions

### 6. Progressive Testing Philosophy
**Lesson**: Exhaustive validation prevents costly production failures  
**Example**: Lambda memory testing (5 GB → 8 GB → 10 GB) definitively proved limitation  
**Value**: Know the boundaries before committing to architecture

### 7. Isolation Architecture
**Lesson**: Shared resources lead to contamination bugs that are hard to debug  
**Example**: Satellite cross-contamination in /tmp directory  
**Solution**: Isolated directories per processing unit (HPC-inspired pattern)
