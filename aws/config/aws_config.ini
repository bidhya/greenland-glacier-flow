# Memory sizing guide based on glacier size and satellite type:
# Landsat processing: 5120 MB (5 GB) - PROVEN SUCCESSFUL ✅
# Sentinel-2 small glaciers (1-2 tiles): 8192 MB (8 GB) - RECOMMENDED
# Sentinel-2 medium glaciers (2-3 tiles): 10240 MB (10 GB) - MAXIMUM
# Large glaciers (4+ tiles): IMPOSSIBLE on Lambda (10 GB max limit) ❌
# 
# Testing results (191_Hagen_Brae - 4 tiles):
# - 5 GB: Failed at 155s (32% progress)
# - 8 GB: Failed at 205s (43% progress)
# - 10 GB: Failed at 301s (63% progress) - Lambda maximum
